# Agent Code Factory Workflow

## Development Workflow Skills

When working on this project, follow the factory workflow using installed skills:

### For New Features or Creative Work
1. **Brainstorm first:** Use the `brainstorming` skill before any creative work (creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior)
2. **Plan before code:** Use the `writing-plans` skill to create a detailed implementation plan before writing any code. Save plans to `docs/plans/`
3. **Execute with subagents:** Use the `subagent-driven-development` skill to dispatch independent tasks to subagents

### For Implementation
4. **TDD:** Use the `test-driven-development` skill — write failing tests before implementation code
5. **Quality signals:** After implementation, run: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run format:check`

### Before Completing Work
6. **Verify:** Use the `verification-before-completion` skill before claiming any work is complete
7. **Review:** Use the `requesting-code-review` skill before merging or delivering

### For Bug Fixes
- Use the `systematic-debugging` skill — investigate root cause before proposing fixes
- Never guess at fixes without evidence

### For Database Changes
- Always use direct Neon connection (no `-pooler`) for DDL operations
- Test migrations on dev database first, then production
- Follow the pattern in `.cursor/agents/neroview-migration.md`

## Available Commands

Use slash commands for common workflows:
- `/new-feature` — Full feature development workflow
- `/fix-bug` — Systematic bug fix workflow
- `/run-tests` — Run test suite and report
- `/quality-check` — Run all quality signals
- `/create-migration` — Create database migration
- `/deploy-check` — Pre-deployment verification

## Custom Subagents

Available specialized subagents in `.cursor/agents/`:
- `neroview-researcher` — Codebase exploration and research
- `neroview-migration` — Database migration creation and execution
- `neroview-tester` — Quality signal verification
- `neroview-reviewer` — Code review against project conventions
